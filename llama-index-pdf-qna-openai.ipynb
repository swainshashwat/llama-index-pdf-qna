Where adjacent buildings are joined  \\nthrough openings in walls, they need not meet additional requirements if they jointly comply with the NCC as a single  \\nbuilding.  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\u200aA7G1\\u200a \\xa0United buildings  \\n[2019: A7.0]  \\nBuildings are deemed united when two or more buildings adjoining each other are connected and used as one building.  \\n \\nApplications  \\nFor A7G1, two or more buildings are a united building if they are connected through openings in the walls dividing  (1)\\nthem and together comply with all the requirements of the NCC as though they are a single building.  \\nA7G1 only applies to Class 2 to 9 buildings.  (2)\\n \\n\\u200aA7G2\\u200a \\xa0Alterations in a united building  \\n[2019: A7.1]  \\nIf, after alterations  or any other building work, two or more of the buildings in A7G1  cease to be connected through openings  \\nin the dividing walls, each of those buildings not now connected must comply with all the requirements for a single building.  \\n \\nExplanatory Information  \\nIt is not unusual for authorities to receive plans proposing the connecting of two or more buildings. Connecting buildings  \\ncould be achieved by breaking openings through walls, or by joining the buildings by a tunnel, bridge or covered walkway.  \\nWhen connected, if the buildings jointly comply with all the requirements of the NCC applying as if they were a single  \\nbuilding, they become a united building.  \\nUnited buildings are not required  to comply with additional NCC provisions. For example, any new openings do not  \\nrequire any form of fire protection not required  of a single building.  \\nNote, however, an external wall , which as a result of an interconnection becomes an internal wall , must comply with the  \\nrequirements for an internal wall . \\nInterconnected buildings that do not jointly comply with all the requirements applicable to a single building, remain as  \\nseparate buildings.  \\nThis raises the possible need for fire doors, or other forms of protection to be fitted to connecting openings.  \\n \\nExplanatory Information: Multiple allotments or ownership  \\nThe NCC does not concern itself with actually prohibiting or permitting the uniting of buildings in separate ownership or  \\non separate allotments. Such matters are dealt with by the relevant local bodies.  \\n \\nExplanatory Information: Example of connection by bridge  \\nIn this example, Building A is connected to Building B by bridge C. There are four different options for designing such  \\na proposal.  \\nThe first is a united building:  Part A7 United buildings\\nGoverning Requirements', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8052865081035375), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='a3dccf00-dce7-4fa7-ba66-2acf0555d0c7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '59', 'file_name': 'ncc-volume-one-20221222.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ca742465-bb9c-45e5-912c-67338551b2bf', node_type=None, metadata={'page_label': '59', 'file_name': 'ncc-volume-one-20221222.pdf'}, hash='67985e0a95d9dd3a96162286451b5f51c0f3805949bc00d9f3d7572e8deef77b'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='88782d11-6031-4333-ac85-d9352a67031f', node_type=None, metadata={'page_label': '59', 'file_name': 'ncc-volume-one-20221222.pdf'}, hash='cfa01b14c74943e68a285aafec313baf5198f4be9ba0baafb016f3cf8b6bae2d')}, hash='c2f85e0918e97ec477d1ece6a9a94c7dcc58302bdca72a1d91e47f418e3a8d42', text='(2) Class 1 includes the following sub-classifications:  \\nClass 1a is one or more buildings, which together form a single dwelling including the following:  (a)\\nA detached house.
